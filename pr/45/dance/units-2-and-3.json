The vigour of the dance represents the high level of effort\nput in by students during the course. Each dancer dances from several\npositions, similar to how we have been taking the position of different\ndancers to demonstrate formations. That the ones are still during bars\n9-24 represents spending time observing other dancers and teachers during\nthe course. The plentiful curving and casting to change positions on the\nside lines was included to demonstrate good kilt control (or lack\nthereof)!”\n"
