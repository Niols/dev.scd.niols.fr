<div class="note">Note: During bars 3-4, 7-8, 27-28 and 31-32, dancers who change place by dancing
in and up/down curve into place.</div>

<div class="devised-by">Devised by <span class="deviser">David Osgarby, RSCDS Canberra and District Branch</span> in St Andrews in July 2022. “I devised this dance at the 2022 St Andrews
Summer School while doing Units 2 and 3 of the RSCDS teaching certificate.
The dance was devised such that the 2s and 3s are showcased representing
Units 2 and 3. The vigour of the dance represents the high level of effort
put in by students during the course. Each dancer dances from several
positions, similar to how we have been taking the position of different
dancers to demonstrate formations. That the ones are still during bars
9-24 represents spending time observing other dancers and teachers during
the course. The plentiful curving and casting to change positions on the
side lines was included to demonstrate good kilt control (or lack
thereof)!”</div>
